All right , all right , not biscuits , but lets kill him anyway .
Right !
He buggered off .
So he has , he 's scarpered .
Brave Sir Robin ran away No !
Bravely ran away away I did n't !
When danger reared its ugly head , He bravely turned his tail and fled No !
Yes Brave Sir Robin turned about I did n't !
And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet I never did !
He beat a very brave retreat Oh , lie !
Bravest of the brave Sir Robin I never !
The Tale of Sir Galahad Open the door !
Open the door !
In the name of King Arthur , open the door !
Hello !
Welcome gentle Sir knight , welcome to the Castle Anthrax .
The Castle Anthrax ?
Yes ...
oh , it 's not a very good name ?
Oh !
but we are nice and we shall attend to your every , every need !
You are the keepers of the Holy Grail ?
The what ?
The Grail -- it is here ?
Oh , but you are tired , and you must rest awhile .
Midget !
Crepper !
Yes , oh Zoot !
Prepare a bed for our guest .
Oh thank you thank you thank you -- Away away vile temptress !
The beds here are warm and soft -- and very , very big .
Well , look , I - I - uh -- What is your name , handsome knight ?
Sir Galahad ...
the Chaste .
Mine is Zoot ...
just Zoot .
Oh , but come !
Look , please !
In God 's name , show me the Grail !
Oh , you have suffered much !
You are delirious !
L - look , I have seen it !
It is here , in the -- Sir Galahad !
You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality .
Well , I - I - uh -- Oh , I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours .
We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes , all between sixteen and nineteen and a half , cut off in this castle with no one to protect us !
Oh , it is a lonely life -- bathing , dressing , undressing , making exciting underwear ... .
We are just not used to handsome knights .
Nay , nay , come , come , you may lie here .
Oh , but you are wounded !
No , no -- i - it 's nothing !
Oh , but you must see the doctors immediately !
No , no , please , lie down .
Ah .
What seems to be the trouble ?
They 're doctors ? !
Uh , they 've had a basic medical training , yes .
B - but -- Oh , come come , you must try to rest !
Doctor Piglet , Doctor Winston , practice your art .
Try to relax .
Are you sure that 's necessary ?
We must examine you .
There 's nothing wrong with that !
Please -- we are doctors .
Get off the bed !
I am sworn to chastity !
Back to your bed !
Torment me no longer !
I have seen the Grail !
There 's no grail here .
I have seen it , I have seen it .
I have seen -- Hello .
Oh -- Hello .
Hello .
Zoot !
No , I am Zoot 's identical twin sister , Dingo .
Oh , well , excuse me , I -- 
Where are you going ?
I seek the Grail !
I have seen it , here in this castle !
No !
Oh , no !
Bad , bad Zoot !
What is it ?
Oh , wicked , bad , naughty Zoot !
She has been setting alight to our beacon , which , I just remembered , is grail - shaped .
It 's not the first time we've had this problem .
It 's not the real Grail ?
Oh , wicked , bad , naughty , evil Zoot !
Oh , she is a naughty person , and she must pay the penalty -- and here in Castle Anthrax , we have but one punishment for setting alight the grail - shaped beacon .
You must tie her down on a bed and spank her !
A spanking !
You must spank her well .
And after you have spanked her , you may deal with her as you like .
And then , spank me .
And spank me .
And me .
Yes , yes , you must give us all a good spanking !
A spanking !
And after the spanking , the oral sex .
Oral sex !
Well , I could stay a BIT longer .
Sir Galahad !
Oh , hello .
Quick !
What ?
Quick !
Why ?
You're in great peril !
Silence , foul temptress !
Now look , it 's not important .
Quick !
Come on and we 'll cover your escape !
Look , I'm fine !
Come on !
Now look , I can tackle this lot single - handed !
Yes !
Let him tackle us single - handed !
Yes !
Tackle us single - handed !
No , Sir Galahad , come on !
No , really , honestly , I can go back and handle this lot easily !
Oh , yes , he can handle us easily .
Yes , yes !
Wait !
I can defeat them !
There 's only a hundred and fifty of them !
Yes , yes , he 'll beat us easily , we have n't a chance .
Yes , yes .
Oh , shit .
We were in the nick of time you were in great peril .
I do n't think I was .
Yes you were , you were in terrible peril .
Look , let me go back in there and face the peril .
No , it 's too perilous .
Look , I'm a knight , I'm supposed to get as much peril as I can .
No , we've got to find the Holy Grail .
Come on !
Well , let me have just a little bit of peril ?
No , it 's unhealthy .
Bet you 're gay !
No , I'm not .
Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation , but they were still no nearer the Grail .
Meanwhile , King Arthur and Sir Bedemir , not more than a swallow 's flight away , had discovered something .
Oh , that 's an unladen swallow 's flight , obviously .
I mean , they were more than two laden swallow 's flights away -- four , really , if they had n't a cord of line between them .
I mean , if the birds were walking and dragging -- Get on with it !
Oh , anyway , on to scene twenty - four , which is a smashing scene with some lovely acting , in which Arthur discovers a vital clue , in which there are n't any swallows , although I think you can hear a starling  - oolp !
Ah , hee he he ha !
And this enchanter of whom you speak , he has seen the grail ?
Ha ha he he he he !
Where does he live ?
Old man , where does he live ?
He knows of a cave , a cave which no man has entered .
And the Grail ...
The Grail is there ?
Very much danger , for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril , which no man has ever crossed .
But the Grail !
Where is the Grail ! ?
Seek you the Bridge of Death .
The Bridge of Death , which leads to the Grail ?
Hee hee ha ha !
Nee !
Who are you ?
We are the Knights Who Say ...
Nee !
No !
Not the Knights Who Say Nee !
The same !
Who are they ?
We are the keepers of the sacred words : Nee , Pen , and Nee - wom !
Nee - wom !
Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale !
The Knights Who Say Nee demand a sacrifice !
Knights of Nee , we are but simple travellers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods .
Nee !
Oh , ow !
We shall say ' nee ' again to you if you do not appease us .
Well , what is it you want ?
We want ...
a shrubbery !
A what ?
Nee !
Oh , ow !
Please , please !
No more !
We shall find a shrubbery .
You must return here with a shrubbery or else you will never pass through this wood alive !
O Knights of Nee , you are just and fair , and we will return with a shrubbery .
One that looks nice .
Of course .
And not too expensive .
Yes .
Now ...
go !
The Tale of Sir Launcelot .
One day , lad , all this will be yours !
What , the curtains ?
No , not the curtains , lad .
All that you can see !
Stretched out over the hills and valleys of this land !
This 'll be your kingdom , lad !
But , Mother -- Father , I'm Father .
But Father , I do n't want any of that .
Listen , lad .
I've built this kingdom up from nothing .
When I started here , all there was was swamp .
All the kings said I was daft to build a castle in a swamp , but I built it all the same , just to show  'em .
It sank into the swamp .
So , I built a second one .
That sank into the swamp .
So I built a third one .
That burned down , fell over , then sank into the swamp .
But the fourth one stayed up .
An ' that 's what your gonna get , lad -- the strongest castle in these islands .
But I do n't want any of that -- I 'd rather -- Rather what ? !
I 'd rather ...
just ...
... sing !
Stop that , stop that !
You're not going to do a song while I'm here .
Now listen lad , in twenty minutes you 're getting married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain .
But I do n't want land .
Listen , Alex , -- Herbert .
Herbert .
We live in a bloody swamp .
We need all the land we can get .
But I do n't like her .
Do n't like her ? !
What 's wrong with her ?
She 's beautiful , she 's rich , she 's got huge ...
tracts of land .
I know , but I want the girl that I marry to have ...
a certain ...
special ...
... something ...
Cut that out , cut that out .
Look , you 're marryin ' Princess Lucky , so you 'd better get used to the idea .
Guards !
Make sure the Prince does n't leave this room until I come and get ' im .
Not to leave the room even if you come and get him .
Hic !
No , no .
Until I come and get ' im .
Until you come and get him , we're not to enter the room .
No , no , no .
You stay in the room and make sure ' e does n't leave .
And you 'll come and get him .
Hic !
Right .
We do n't need to do anything , apart from just stop him entering the room .
No , no .
Leaving the room .
Leaving the room , yes .
All right ?
Right .
Oh , if - if - if , uh , if - if - if , uh , if - if - if we ...
Yes , what is it ?
Oh , if - if , oh -- Look , it 's quite simple .
Uh ...
You just stay here , and make sure ' e does n't leave the room .
All right ?
Hic !
Right .
Oh , I remember .
Uh , can he leave the room with us ?
N - No no no .
You just keep him in here , and make sure -- Oh , yes , we 'll keep him in here , obviously .
But if he had to leave and we were -- No , no , just keep him in here -- Until you , or anyone else , -- No , not anyone else , just me -- Just you .
Hic !
Get back .
Right ?
Right , we 'll stay here until you get back .
And , uh , make sure he does n't leave .
What ?
Make sure ' e does n't leave .
The Prince ?
Yes , make sure ' e does n't leave .
Oh , yes , of course .
I thought you meant him .
Y'know , it seemed a bit daft , me havin ' to guard him when he 's a guard .
Is that clear ?
Hic !
Oh , quite clear , no problems .
Right .
Where are you going ?
We're coming with you .
No no , I want you to stay ' ere and make sure ' e does n't leave .
Oh , I see .
Right .
But , Father !
Shut your noise , you !
And get that suit on !
And no singing !
Hic !
Oh , go get a glass of water .
Well taken , Concorde !
Thank you , sir !
Most kind .
And again ...
Over we go !
Good .
Steady !
And now , the big one ...
Ooof !
Come on , Concorde !
Message for you , sir .
Concorde !
Concorde , speak to me !
" To whoever finds this note , I have been imprisoned by my father , who wishes me to marry against my will .
Please , please , please come and rescue me .
I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle .
" At last !
A call , a cry of distress !
This could be the sign that leads us to the Holy Grail !
Brave , brave Concorde !
You shall not have died in vain !
Uh , I'm - I'm not quite dead , sir .
Well , you shall not have been mortally wounded in vain !
Uh , I - I think uh , I could pull through , sir .
Oh , I see .
Actually , I think I'm all right to come with you -- No , no , sweet Concorde !
Stay here !
I will send help as soon as I have accomplished a daring and heroic rescue in my own particular ...
Idiom , sir ?
Idiom !
No , I feel fine , actually , sir .
Farewell , sweet Concorde !
I 'll - uh , I 'll just stay here , then , shall I , sir ?
Yeah .
Ha - ha !
etc .
Now , you 're not allowed to come in here , and we're - ugh !
O fair one , behold your humble servant Sir Launcelot of Camelot .
I have come to take -- oh , I'm terribly sorry .
You got my note !
Uh , well , I got A note .
You 've come to rescue me !
Uh , well , no , you see ...
I knew that someone would , I knew that somewhere out there ...
there must be ...
 ...
someone ...
Stop that , stop that , stop it !
Stop it !
Who are you ?
I'm your son !
No , not you .
I'm Sir Launcelot , sir .
He 's come to rescue me , father .
Well , let 's not jump to conclusions .
Did you kill all the guard ?
Uh ...
 , oh , yes .
Sorry .
They cost fifty pounds each .
Well , I'm awfully sorry , I'm -- I really can explain everything .
Do n't be afraid of him , Sir Launcelot , I've got a rope all ready !
You killed eight wedding guests in all !
Well , you see , the thing is , I thought your son was a lady .
I can understand that .
Hurry , Sir Launcelot !
Hurry !
Shut up !
You only killed the bride 's father , that 's all !
Well , I really did n't mean to ...
Did n't mean to ? !
You put your sword right through his head !
Oh , dear .
Is he all right ?
You even kicked the bride in the chest !
This is going to cost me a fortune !
Well , I can explain .
I was in the forest , um , riding north from Camelot , when I got this note , you see -- Camelot ?
Are you from , uh , Camelot ?
Hurry , Sir Launcelot !
Uh , I am a Knight of King Arthur , sir .
Pretty nice castle , Camelot .
Uh , pretty good pig country ... .
Yes .
Hurry , I'm ready !
Would you , uh , like to come and have a drink ?
Well , that 's , uh , awfully nice of you .
I am ready !
 -- I mean to be , so understanding .
Oooh !
Um , I think when I'm in this idiom , I sometimes get a bit , uh , sort of carried away .
Oh , do n't worry about that .
Oooh !
Well , this is the main hall .
We're going to have all this knocked through , and made into one big , uh , living room .
There he is !
Oh , bloody hell .
Ha - ha !
etc .
Hold it , hold it !
Please !
Sorry , sorry .
See what I mean , I just get carried away .
I really must -- sorry , sorry !
Sorry , everyone .
He 's killed the best man !
Hold it , please !
Hold it !
This is Sir Launcelot from the court of Camelot -- a very brave and influential knight , and my special guest here today .
Hello .
He killed my auntie !
Please , please !
This is supposed to be a happy occasion !
Let 's not bicker and argue about who killed who .
We are here today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of the holy wedlock .
Unfortunately , one of them , my son Herbert , has just fallen to his death .
But I think I've not lost a son , so much as ...
gained a daughter !
For , since the tragic death of her father -- He 's not quite dead !
Since the near fatal wounding of her father -- He 's getting better !
For , since her own father ...
who , when he seemed about to recover , suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him , ...
Oh , he 's died !
And I want his only daughter to look upon me ...
as her own dad -- in a very real , and legally binding sense .
And I feel sure that the merger -- uh , the union -- between the Princess and the brave , but dangerous , Sir Launcelot of Camelot ...
What ?
Look !
The dead Prince !
He 's not quite dead !
Oh , I feel much better .
You fell out of the tower , you creep !
No , I was saved at the last minute .
How ? !
Well , I 'll tell you ...
Not like that !
No , stop it !
He 's going to tell !
Shut up !
He 's going to tell !
Quickly , sir !
This way !
No , it 's not in my idiom !
I must escape more ... .
Dramatically , sir ?
Dramatically !
Hee !
Ha !
Excuse me , could , uh , could somebody give me a push , please ... ?
Old crone !
Is there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery !
Who sent you ?
The Knights Who Say Nee .
Agh !
No !
Never !
We have no shrubberies here .
If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery , my friend and I will say ...
we will say ...
` nee ' .
Agh !
Do your worst !
Very well !
If you will not assist us voluntarily , ...
nee !
No !
Never !
No shrubberies !
Nee !
Noo !
No , no , no , no -- it 's not that , it 's ' nee ' .
Noo !
No , no -- ' nee ' .
You're not doing it properly .
Noo !
Nee !
That 's it , that 's it , you 've got it .
Nee !
Are you saying ' nee ' to that old woman ?
Um , yes .
Oh , what sad time are these when passing ruffians can say ` nee ' at will to old ladies .
There is a pestilence upon this land , nothing is sacred .
Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this period in history .
Did you say ` shrubberies ' ?
Yes , shrubberies are my trade -- I am a shrubber .
My name is Roger the Shrubber .
I arrange , design , and sell shrubberies .
Nee !
No !
No , no , no !
No !
O , Knights of Nee , we have brought you your shrubbery .
May we go now ?
It is a good shrubbery .
I like the laurels particularly .
But there is one small problem .
What is that ?
We are now ...
no longer the Knights Who Say Nee .
Nee !
Shh shh .
We are now the Knights Who Say Ecky - ecky - ecky - ecky - pikang - zoom - boing - mumble - mumble .
Nee !
Therefore , we must give you a test .
What is this test , O Knights of --  Knights Who ' Til Recently Said Nee ?
Firstly , you must find ...
another shrubbery !
Not another shrubbery !
Then , when you have found the shrubbery , you must place it here beside this shrubbery , only slightly higher so you get a two - level effect with a little path running down the middle .
A path !
Nee !
Then , when you have found the shrubbery , you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ...
with ...
a herring !
We shall do no such thing !
Oh , please !
Cut down a tree with a herring ?
It can't be done .
Aaaaugh !
Aaaugh !
Do n't say that word .
What word ?
I cannot tell , suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Nee cannot hear .
How can we not say the word if you do n't tell us what it is ?
Aaaaugh !
Aaaugh !
What , ` is' ?
No , not ` is' -- we could n't get vary far in life not saying ` is' .
My liege , it 's Sir Robin !
Packing it in and packing it up And sneaking away and buggering up And chickening out and pissing about Yes , bravely he is throwing in the sponge Oh , Robin !
My liege !
It 's good to see you !
Aaaaugh !
He said the word !
Surely you 've not given up your quest for the Holy Grail ?
He is sneaking away and buggering up -- Shut up !
No , no no --  far from it .
He said the word again !
I was looking for it .
Aaaaugh !
Uh , here , here in this forest .
No , it is far from -- Aaaaugh !
Aaaaugh !
Stop saying the word !
Oh , stop it !
Aaaaugh !
Oh !
He said it again !
Patsy !
Aaugh !
I said it !
Ooh !
I said it again !
Aaaaugh !
And so Arthur and Bedemir and Sir Robin set out on their search to find the enchanter of whom the keeper had spoken in Scene 24 .
Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad , and there was much rejoicing .
Yay !
In the frozen land of Nador they were forced to eat Robin 's minstrels .
And there was much rejoicing .
Yay !
A year passed .
Winter changed into Spring .
Spring changed into Summer .
Summer changed back into Winter .
And Winter gave Spring and Summer a miss and went straight on into Autumn .
Until one day ...
Knights !
Forward !
What manner of man are you that can summon up fire without flint or tinder ?
I ... am an enchanter .
By what name are you known ?
There are some who call me ... Tim .
Greetings , Tim the Enchanter .
Greetings , King Arthur !
You know my name ?
I do .
You seek the Holy Grail !
That is our quest .
You know much that is hidden , O Tim the Enchanter .
Quite .
Yes , we're , we're looking for the Grail .
Our quest is to find the Holy Grail .
It is , yes , yup , yes , yeah .
And so we're , we're , we're , we're looking for it .
Yes we are we are .
We have been for some time .
Ages .
Uh , so , uh , anything you can do to , uh , to help , would be ...
very ...
helpful ...
Look , can you tell us wh - Fine , um , I do n't want to waste anymore of your time , but , uh I do n't suppose you could , uh , tell us where we might find a , um , find a , uh , a , um , a uh -- A what ... ?
A g --  , a g -- A Grail ? !
Yes , I think so .
Yes , that 's it .
Yes .
Yes !
Oh , thank you , splendid , fine .
Look , you 're a busy man , uh -- 
Yes , I can help you find the Holy Grail .
Oh , thank you .
To the north there lies a cave -- the cave of Kyre Banorg  -- wherein , carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock , the last words of Ulfin Bedweer of Regett proclaim the last resting place of the most Holy Grail .
Where could we find this cave , O Tim the Enchanter ?
Follow !
But !
follow only if ye be men of valor , for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul , so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived !
Bones of four fifty men lie strewn about its lair .
So , brave knights , if you do doubt your courage or your strength , come no further , for death awaits you all with nasty big pointy teeth .
What an eccentric performance .
They 're nervous , sire .
Then we 'd best leave them here and carry on on foot .
Dis - mount !
Behold the cave of Kyre Banorg !
Right !
Keep me covered .
What with ?
Just keep me covered .
Too late !
What ?
There he is !
Where ?
There !
What , behind the rabbit ?
It is the rabbit !
You silly sod !
You got us all worked up !
Well , that 's no ordinary rabbit .
That 's the most foul , cruel , and bad - tempered rodent you ever set eyes on .
You tit !
I soiled my armor I was so scared !
Look , that rabbit 's got a vicious streak a mile wide , it 's a killer !
Get stuffed !
It 'll do you a trick , mate !
Oh , yeah ?
You mangy Scot git !
I'm warning you !
What 's he do , nibble your bum ?
He 's got huge , sharp --  he can leap about --  look at the bones !
Go on , Boris .
Chop his head off !
Right !
Silly little bleeder .
One rabbit stew comin ' right up !
Look !
Aaaugh !
Jesus Christ !
I warned you !
I peed again !
I warned you !
But did you listen to me ?
Oh , no , you knew it all , did n't you ?
Oh , it 's just a harmless little bunny , is n't it ?
Well , it 's always the same , I always -- Oh , shut up !
-- But do they listen to me ?
-- Right !
- Oh , no -- Charge !
Aaaaugh !
Aaaugh !
etc .
Run away !
Haw haw haw .
Haw haw .
Right .
How many did we lose ?
Gawain .
Hector .
And Boris .
That 's five .
Three , sir .
Three .
And we 'd better not risk another frontal assault , that rabbit 's dynamite .
Would it help to confuse it if we run away more ?
Oh , shut up and go and change your armor .
Let us taunt it !
It may become so cross that it will make a mistake .
Like what ?
Well , ... .
Have we got bows ?
No .
We have the Holy Hand Grenade .
Yes , of course !
The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch !
' Tis one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him !
Brother Maynard !
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade !
How does it , uh ...
how does it work ?
I know not , my liege .
Consult the Book of Armaments !
Armaments , Chapter Two , Verses Nine to Twenty - One .
" And Saint Atila raised the hand grenade up on high , saying , ' Oh , Lord , bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou mayest blow thy enemies to tiny bits , in thy mercy .
' And the Lord did grin , and people did feast upon the lambs , and sloths , and carp , and anchovies , and orangutans , and breakfast cereals , and fruit bats , and large  -- " Skip a bit , Brother .
" And the Lord spake , saying , ' First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin .
Then , shalt thou count to three , no more , no less .
Three shalt be the number thou shalt count , and the number of the counting shalt be three .
Four shalt thou not count , nor either count thou two , excepting that thou then proceed to three .
Five is right out .
Once the number three , being the third number , be reached , then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thou foe , who being naughty in my sight , shall snuff it .
' " Amen .
Amen .
Right !
One ...
two ...
five !
Three , sir !
Three !
Look !
What does it say ?
What language is that ?
Brother Maynard , you 're our scholar !
It 's Aramaic !
Of course !
Joseph of Aramathea !
Course !
What does it say ?
It reads , ' Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Aramathea .
He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail in the Castle of uuggggggh ' .
What ?
' ...
the Castle of uuggggggh ' .
What is that ?
He must have died while carving it .
Oh , come on !
Well , that 's what it says .
Look , if he was dying , he would n't bother to carve ' aaggggh ' .
He 'd just say it !
Well , that 's what 's carved in the rock !
Perhaps he was dictating .
Oh , shut up .
Well , does it say anything else ?
No .
Just , ' uuggggggh ' .
Aauuggghhh .
Aaauggh .
You do n't suppose he meant the Camauuuugh ?
Where 's that ?
France , I think .
Is n't there a Saint Aauuuves in Cornwall ?
No , that 's Saint Ives .
Oh , yes .
Saint Iiiives .
Iiiiives .
Oooohoohohooo !
No , no , aauuuuugh , at the back of the throat .
Aauuugh .
No , no , no , oooooooh , in surprise and alarm .
Oh , you mean sort of a aaaagh !
Yes , but I --  Aaaaagh !
Oooh !
Oh , no !
It 's the legendary Black Beast of aaauuugh !
Run away !
Run away !
Run away !
As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward , escape for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless .
When , suddenly , the animator suffered a fatal heart attack .
The cartoon peril was no more .
The Quest for the Holy Grail could continue .
There it is !
The Bridge of Death !
Oh , great .
Look !
There 's the keeper from Scene 24 !
What is he doing here ?
He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death .
He asks each traveller five questions -- Three questions .
Three questions .
He who answers the five questions -- Three questions .
Three questions may cross in safety .
What if you get a question wrong ?
Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril .
Oh , I wo n't go .
Who 's going to answer the questions ?
Sir Robin !
Yes ?
Brave Sir Robin , you go .
Hey !
I've got a great idea .
Why does n't Launcelot go ?
Yes , let me go , my liege .
I will take him single - handed .
I shall make a feint to the north - east -- No , no , hang on , hang on , hang on !
Just answer the five questions -- Three questions .
Three questions as best you can .
And we shall watch ...
and pray .
I understand , my liege .
Good luck , brave Sir Launcelot .
God be with you .
