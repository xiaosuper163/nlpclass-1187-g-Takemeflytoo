* The work I have done for the final submission:
  * Implement the approaches of generating rules for S1 with example_sentences.txt and/or devset.txt. In achiving this, I:
    - Produced parsed trees with Berkeley Neural Parser
    - Generated weighted rules from parsed trees

For more details around how this approach works, please see the jupyter notebook `'cgw.ipynb'`.
