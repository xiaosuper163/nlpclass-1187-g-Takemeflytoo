Competitive Grammar Writing in Python
=====================================

`S1.gr` S1 grammar file   
`S2.gr` S2 grammar file   
`Vocab.gr` Vocab file   
`cgw.ipynb` Jupyter notebook   
**Note:** the file names in the jupyter notebook are not same as four file names listed above. The reason is we manually combine `S1\_tunedE.gr` and `S2\_test.gr` mentioned in the jupyter notebook.
