* Read paper "Improving IBM Word-Alignment Model 1"

* Discussion with group members

* Implemented log-likelihood-ratio(LLR) approach for initialization, see LLR.py

* Debug and tested LLR for different approaches, but we didn't include it in our final submission since it sometimes makes the results worse
