    "This is the implementation of the reference 'Improved Decipherment of Homophonic Ciphers'. The goal is to find the best extension order. As the paper mentioned, it is important to find a better optimal extension order which is helpful to improve both the speed and accuracy. If the correct answer has been pruned out at a very early stage, it is not quite possible that the text can be fully deciphered since the following score is computed based on a wrong partial deciphered text. With beam size of 10000, we experimented with several sets of extension orders. With the help of ground truth, we are able to monitor when the correct answer has been pruned. If we follow the frequency order of those symbols, the correct answer can be pruned as early as the fourth or fifth iteration. Finally, I chose the weights \\[1,1,1,1,2,3\\] suggested by Anoop in a discussion post."

    "The first change I made to the baseline was to rewrite the score function to optimize the running speed. The change I made is to score the newly fixed symbol plantext character pair and corresponding influenced previously fixed plantext character based on the previous score instead of scoring the whole bitstring in each iteration. For instance, 'oooo...o' -> 'oooo..xo'. The new score can be calculated by adding unigram score of 'x' to the previous score, substracting unigram score of 'o' following 'x' and bigram score of '<\\s>' from the previous score, and adding bigram score of 'o' following 'x' and trigram score of '<\\s>' to the previous score. With this approach, the running time was improved to 20 minitues from more than one hour with a beamsize of 10000 on my machine with i7 7700k cpu. And the computed score is almost same as the score computed with score_bit_string function (the difference is within 0.00000000001). Another approach to speed up the whole process we tried is multiprocessing. We will talk about that in details in the following notebook."

    "As briefly mentioned above, we use different ext_limit for different plaintext symbol. We use the following `ext_limits` to limit the ext_order. The goal is to customize the `ext_limit` for each plaintext character so that more symbols can be mapped to the more frequent plaintext character. The `ext_limit` is calculated by multiplying the relative frequency of the paintext character in wiki text by the number of unique cipher symbols. We believe this can dramatically improve the running time since the required amount of computation in each iteration is minimized. We use the ceiling instead of floor to ensure the `ext_limit` is large enough. Of course this approach might not be perfect if less frequent plaintext character is mapped to more cipher symbols. But even that is the case, the error rate should not increase significantly since the frequency of those less frequent plaintext should not be large (if the character distribution of the plaintext in the cipher task is similar to that of the one used to train the language model)."
