* Jupyter notebook running note to TA: 


Our multiprocessing implementation doesn't work for Windows operating system. If you are using Windows machine, please kindly manually change the code in the second last cell. Comment out the line under `# multiprocessing version` and use the line under `# single core version` instead. The beam size can be adjusted there if you want to. Also, we set the extension limit individually for each plaintext character according the number of unique cipher symbols and frequency of plaintext character. If you think it is necessary to set the ext_limits to the same number for each plaintext sysmbol, please use the third last cell and adjust the `constant_ext_limit` to the one you may want to use. Thanks a lot!
