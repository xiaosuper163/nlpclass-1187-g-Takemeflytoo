* Jupyter notebook Running note to TA: 

Our multiprocessing implementation doesn't work for Windows operating system. If you are using Windows machine, please kindly manually change the code in the second last cell. Comment out the line under `# multiprocessing version` and use the line under `# single core version` instead. The beam size can be adjusted there if you want to. Thanks!
