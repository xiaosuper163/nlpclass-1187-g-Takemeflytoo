* I implemented the multiprocessing version of the beam_search function based on yabin's original single threaded beam_search function. It is included in the final submission.

* Read paper "Improved Decipherment of Homophonic Ciphers", and implemented the "backup version" of the extension order function. It is not included in the final submission, for details, please see decipher_junbob.ipynb.

* Experiments on weights, ext_limits, ext_orders and the beam size
